This project contains core-contents of the discovery-system developed by Thüringer Universitäts- & Landesbibliothek Jena (ThULB).<br>
It uses an open-source project called [VuFind](https://vufind.org/vufind/).<br>
We are building and hosting the following discovery-sytems:
* [ThULB Suche](http://suche.thulb.uni-jena.de)
* [DHGE - Duale Hochschule Gera-Eisenach](https://bibsuche.dhge.de/)
* [EAH - Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena](https://katalogplus.bibliothek.eah-jena.de/)

See folder *vufind* for a detailed README and all customizations in modules and themes by ThULB.

Feel free to use the code in your own vufind-project or catch the plain resources from [VuFind.org](https://vufind.org/vufind/).<br>
Don't hesitate to get in touch with us - if any questions appear.<br>
Either use our [Service-Desk](https://servicedesk.uni-jena.de/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/140/create/1001?customfield_12342=20009) or write to discovery_thulb[at]uni-jena.de.<br>
We are also open for new feature-ideas and support from the community.

Team ThULB-Suche.
